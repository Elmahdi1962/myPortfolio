                Well, I discovered programming in 2016 from the curiosity of how video games
                are made, so I wanted to be a game developer, I started from there learning
                unity3D and c# and that journey was a year long I built 2 video games from
                scratch, but I was still not confident with my skills and I was so far from
                getting a job it's was a hard journey and unfortunately I gave up I took a 
                break and changed to full stack web development  I learned html, CSS, some
                js, python, and Django and same thing learning and giving up, and I got 
                really mad at myself and I took a year and half long break (I was working in
                a farm at this period of time) I was depressed because I couldn't achieve my
                dream job, but this time I was determined to make my dream come true but this
                time after some research I specialised on front end web development I started 
                over with freecodecamp curriculum and so far I'm good I learned Html, CSS, sass,
                js, react, and I'm learning d3 and I made this portfolio with react and it's my 
                first full react app I made from scratch.
